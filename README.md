# Aviation Accident Analysis

## 1.  Business Understanding

### Problem Statement

A company is expanding into new industries to diversify its portfolio, with a specific interest in acquiring and operating airplanes for both commercial and private ventures. However, they lack knowledge about the potential risks associated with aircraft. 

The objective is to identify which aircraft pose the lowest risk for the company to enter this new market. These findings should be converted into actionable insights to guide the head of the new aviation division in making informed decisions about aircraft purchases.

### Goal

The goal of this project is to use data cleaning, imputation, analysis, and visualization to generate insights for a business stakeholder who is interested in purchasing and operating airplanes for commercial and private enterprises.

The aim is therefore to translate the findings into actionable insights that the head of the new aviation division can use to help decide which aircraft to purchase.

### Objectives

#### General Objective

To determine which aircraft are least likely to be involved in accidents. This information will assist the head of the new aviation division in making informed decisions on which aircraft to purchase and operate for commercial and private ventures.

#### Specific Objectives

1. To understand the problem statement, the project's objectives, and the dataset utilized.

2. To apply data cleaning techniques to generate actionable insights.

3. To analyze the data through univariate and bivariate analysis of variables.

### Data Description

The data used is from the National Transportation Safety Board that includes aviation accident data from 1962 to 2023 about civil aviation accidents and selected incidents in the United States and international waters.
 
## 2. Data Preparation

Completeness - Ensure the dataset has no missing values.

Uniformity - Maintain consistent data representation.

Consistency - Resolve any discrepancies in the data.


## 3. Analysis

Univariate and Bivariate Analysis

 
## 6. Conclusion and Recommendations

### Conclusion

For data cleaning, missing values were addressed, duplicates were eliminated, type conversions were performed, and data consistency was ensured by standardizing string formats in certain columns.

The top five flight purposes for aircraft involved in accidents were personal, instructional, aerial application, business, and positioning. Given that the stakeholder plans to purchase and operate aircraft for both commercial and private use, this variable was the focus of the bivariate analysis.

### Recommendations

The head of the new aviation division is advised to consider the following:

1. Purchase aircrafts from the Bell or Mooney manufacturers.

2. Opt for a helicopter over an airplane.

3. Choose aircrafts with Turbo Shaft, Turbo Fan, or Turbo Prop engine types.
