# Aviation Accident Analysis

## 1.  Business Understanding

### Problem Statement

A company is expanding in to new industries to diversify its portfolio. Specifically, they are interested in purchasing and operating airplanes for commercial and private enterprises, but do not know anything about the potential risks of aircraft. 

The task is determining which aircrafts are the lowest risk for the company to start this new business venture. The findings should then be translated into actionable insights that the head of the new aviation division can use to help decide which aircraft to purchase.

### Goal

The goal of this project is to use data cleaning, imputation, analysis, and visualization to generate insights for a business stakeholder who is interested in purchasing and operating airplanes for commercial and private enterprises.

The aim is therefore to translate the findings into actionable insights that the head of the new aviation division can use to help decide which aircraft to purchase.

### Objectives

#### General Objective

To identify the aircrafts that are less prone to be involved in an accident. This will help the head of the new aviation division to decide which aircraft to purchase and operate for commercial and private enterprises.

#### Specific Objectives

To understand the problem statement, the goal and dataset used in the project.

To use various data cleaning techniques in order to make actionable insights.

To analyse the data by both univariate and bivariate analysis for the various variables.

### Data Description

The data used is from the National Transportation Safety Board that includes aviation accident data from 1962 to 2023 about civil aviation accidents and selected incidents in the United States and international waters.
 
## 2. Data Preparation

Uniformity - Ensures Consistent Data Representation

Consistency - Eliminates Discrepancies

Completeness - Ensure the dataset has no missing values


## 3. Analysis

Univariate Analysis - Analysis of one variable.

Bivariate Analysis - Analysis of two variables.

 
## 6. Conclusion and Recommendations

### Conclusion

For data cleaning, missing values were handled, duplicates were removed, type conversion was done and data consistency has also been ensured by making the strings in some of the columns to have similar format.

Top five flight purposes for the aircrafts that were involved in accidents was personal, instructional, aerial application, business and positioning. Since the stakeholder is looking to purchase and operate aircrafts for commercial and private enterprises this was the main variable used in the bivariate analysis.

### Recommendations

The head of the new aviation division should purchase:

1. Aircrafts of the make Bell or Mooney

2. A helicopter instead of an Airplane

3. Aircrafts with engine type of Turbo Shaft, Turbo Fan, Turbo Prop
